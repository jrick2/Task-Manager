# Task-Manager
I didn't really right down the code for the public folder because, I still haven't grasp what it's like to create the interaction for the user side of thing. But I do already have experience to it because of my background knowledge on creating a django app, with a working front-end, back-end and ofcourse
an API with middleware. To see for your self what I'm talking about it here https://github.com/jrick2/Blog-Post
